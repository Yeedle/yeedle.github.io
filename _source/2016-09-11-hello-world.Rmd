Every book needs a cover, every jar a lid, and every blog an 'hello world' post. This is mine. Hello and welcome to my blog.

This blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](pages.github,com), powered by [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com), themed by [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), and generated by [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-jekyll)[^1].
